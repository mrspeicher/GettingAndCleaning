Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
Readme File

Introduction

This repository contains the following work for my project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization:

run_analysis.R This file contains the R code that produces the file tidy.txt, according to the course directions for this assigment.

Codebook.Rmd This file is an R Markdown file outlining the variable transformations

Readme.txt  This file.

About the raw data

A full description of the data can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data and associated files can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. The activity labels are in the y_test.txt file. The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file; The same holds for the training set.

About the script and the tidy dataset

The script is called run_analysis.R. This script does the following to create the tidy.txt data file:

The UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted; and,
The UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

From this data the script does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

About the Code Book

The CodeBook.Rmd file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
